# Setting up my personal webiste with Github Pages and Jekyll

I've dabbled in setting up my personal website through the years to a method to learn how to create websites and become familiar with various tools to build webistes. My first website that I built was back in 8th grade back in the mid-90's.  I did jump into it again sometime in college when my school hosted some pre-built solutions to host pictures but I really got interested in building a personal website when I started working at Brontes Technologies. 

I built a simple webpage yet overcomplicated website with Rails and Linode. That setup was way too much for a just a personal website (and expensive at that). I did learn a lot from that experience and would recommend it as a great learning experience though. 

Now in 2020, a little wiser, a lot older and I value my time so much more now to deal with the upkeep of a webserver. 

There were paid solutions to create some pretty websites but Github Pages has what I needed to start out.  I wanted a simple site to help highlight some of my expeience for job searchs to possible employers, to start tracking some of the various projects I embark on, and to improve my writing skillsets. 

Here are some of the various tutorials I referenced from other people who paved the way before me.

Since I had a custom domain and wanted to continue to use it, I wanted to check first if that could even work with Namecheap and Github Pages. Fortunatly, someone had posted exactly what you need to do to configure the Namescheap built-in DNS to route Github Pages. 

If you want to have you own custom domain, I would recommend Namescheap but I did originally purchase my domain from GoDaddy. I moved from GoDaddy due to their position on SOPA and other domain name registrars offerred more capabilties at a better price.
